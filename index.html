			<div class="poem">
				Here is an excerpt from a poem by Rudyard Kipling that I like: <br><br> If you can keep your head when all about you<br> Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br> If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br> But make allowance for their
				doubting too:<br> If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br> Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br> Or being hated don't give way to hating,<br> And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;<br> If you can dream - and not make dreams
				your master;<br> If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim,<br> If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br> And treat those two impostors just the same:.<br> If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br> Twisted by knaves to make a
				trap for fools,<br> Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br> And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;<br>
